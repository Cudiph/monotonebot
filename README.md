# Monotone Bot 
**An EPIC Discord bot written in JavaScript**

## Setting up your bot
To create your bot application, you can read the official 
[discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)  
After getting the bot token you can copy it and put in `.env` file which will be explained in the
[running the bot](#running-the-bot) section

To add your bot to your server, look [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html)  
The invite link should look like this:  
`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=762578055939620864&permissions=8&scope=bot`

You can try this bot by inviting the public bot with the link above

## Prerequisites
* [git][git]
* [nodejs][nodejs]
* [mongoDB][mongodb]
* [yarn 2][yarn]
* [java 13][java] and [lavalink][lavalink] (dev branch)

## `.env` File
.env is file that stored super secret information like your bot token.  
Here is the list of variable you should put in .env file :
- `TOKEN` = Token from the application in [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/).
- `MONGO_URL` = Full URL of the MongoDB cluster if you're using a remote database
- `LAVA_HOST` = Address of your lavalink server
- `LAVA_PASS` = Password of your lavalink server

## Lavalink
Download lavalink binaries from [the CI server][lavalink] and put the jar file
in the root directory of this project and start lavalink server with
`$ java -jar ./Lavalink.jar`.

## Running the bot
After [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are installed and your bot is already in your server,  
follow the steps below to run it:
1. Clone this repo with `git clone <this repo url>`, or download the zipped file.
1. Then move to the project root directory and begin with setting up the`.env` file.  
    First copy the [`.env.example`](./.env.example)
    file still in the current directory then paste and rename it to only `.env`.  
    Now open the file and change the value of `TOKEN` with your secret bot token,  
    and `MONGO_URL` with your Mongo database URI.
1. After that you can install required dependencies with `yarn install`. (Make sure you're using
    yarn 2 with `yarn set version 2`)
1. Before starting the bot please check the MongoDB service if it's running and if you're running Mongo in locally
1. And finally you can run the bot with the command `yarn start` or `npm start`
1. Congrats! You've run the bot ü•≥
